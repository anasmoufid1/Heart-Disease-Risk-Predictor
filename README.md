# Heart Disease Prediction Tool

## Overview

This project involves developing a tool to predict the likelihood of heart disease within the next 10 years. The process includes data analysis, preparation, and leveraging distributed data processing with Apache Spark to train various models. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 88% using a Random Forest classifier.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Analysis
- Carefully analyzed the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and features.
- Explored correlations, distributions, and other statistical properties of the data.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to make it suitable for modeling.
- Handled missing values, normalized features, and performed feature engineering to enhance model performance.

### 3. Distributed Data Processing
- Leveraged the power of Apache Spark in a cluster environment for efficient and scalable data processing.
- Ensured that the data processing steps were optimized for distributed computing.

### 4. Model Training
- Trained various machine learning models to identify the best one for predicting heart disease.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

### 5. Best Model
- The Random Forest classifier was selected as the best-performing model.
- Achieved a high accuracy of 88%.
